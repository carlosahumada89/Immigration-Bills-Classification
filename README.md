# Immigration Bills Classification

In this project I am going to use dataset on immigration bills from 1947 to 2016 in the U.S. Congress obtained from the Comparative Agendas Project. This dataset contains a brief description (usually one sentence) of the topic of the bill, along with other variables such as name of the Legislator who presented the bill, the date, the party, and others. Using a Naive Bayes model, I am going to predict whether a bill was presented by a Republican or a Democrat based on the description. Since the descriptions contains the main topic of the bills, this algortihm should find enough differences between Democrats and Republicans to correctly classify them.
